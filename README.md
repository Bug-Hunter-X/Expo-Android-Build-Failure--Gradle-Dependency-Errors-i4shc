# Expo Android Build Failure: Gradle Dependency Resolution

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android apps using the Expo CLI. The problem stems from inconsistencies in the project's dependency declarations within the `android/app/build.gradle` file, leading to Gradle build failures.

## Problem

The original `build.gradle` file (found in `build.gradle`) contains incorrect or missing dependencies, resulting in errors like `Could not find method android()` during the build process.  These errors usually indicate a problem resolving dependencies required by the Android build system.

## Solution

The corrected `build.gradle` file (located in `build.gradle.fixed`) addresses these issues.  The solution may involve updating dependency versions, adding missing dependencies, or resolving dependency conflicts to ensure compatibility between all project components.  Careful review of the Gradle error messages is crucial for diagnosing the root cause and implementing the correct fix. 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Observe the original `build.gradle` file to see the erroneous dependencies.
3. Compare it to the corrected `build.gradle.fixed` to understand the changes made to resolve the issue.
4.  Remember that specific fixes might vary based on the precise error message and project setup. Always refer to the original Gradle error messages for detailed guidance on resolving dependencies.
