This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `android/app/build.gradle` file.  Specifically, it happens when there's a mismatch between the declared dependencies in the `build.gradle` file and the actual dependencies available in your project.  This might be due to incorrect version numbers, missing dependencies, or conflicts between dependencies.  The error message often mentions issues with `com.android.tools.build:gradle`, or other related Android build tools.  It might manifest as a `Could not find method android()` or similar, indicating a problem during the Gradle build process.
